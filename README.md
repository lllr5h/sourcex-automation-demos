# SourceX Automation Demos

A compact, professional portfolio showing **live-style demos**, **code samples (Python/JS)**, **technical documentation**, and **case-study style outcomes** across three automation projects:

- **AI Voice Assistant (Restaurants / Professional Services)**
- **Apollo Lead Generation (B2B enrichment + scoring)**
- **LinkedIn → Email Automation (multi-channel outreach)**

> This repo is structured to be *client-facing*: clear READMEs, diagrams, small but real code, and docs you can share in a call.

---

## Quick Start

1. Explore the three project folders:
   - `ai-voice-assistant/`
   - `apollo-lead-gen/`
   - `linkedin-email-automation/`

2. Open each `README.md` for architecture, demo scripts, and code pointers.
3. Import the sample **n8n** workflows from `n8n-workflows/` if you want to showcase flows in action.
4. Replace placeholders (API keys, webhook URLs, enrichment provider) with your own.

---

## Live Demo Plan (Suggested)
- Record short Loom walkthroughs (2–3 min each) following the `docs/demo-script.md` in each folder.
- Add your Loom links to this section:

- AI Voice Assistant Loom: _add link_
- Apollo Lead Gen Loom: _add link_
- LinkedIn → Email Loom: _add link_

---

## Tech Stack (example)
- **n8n** for orchestration
- **Node.js (Express)** for webhooks, routing, integrations
- **Python** for data processing, scoring, CSV export
- **PostgreSQL / SQLite** (optional) for persistence
- Third‑party **lead enrichment API** (choose your vendor)
- **Email transport** via SMTP / Nodemailer

---

## Case Studies
See `*/docs/case-study.md` in each folder for business framing: **Problem → Solution → Architecture → Outcomes**.
